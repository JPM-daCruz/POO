Consider a grid n×m. We want to find the best path, that is, the path with lowest cost between
an initial point, with coordinates (xi
, yi), and a final point, with coordinates (xf , yf ). Each path
has an associated cost that is determined by the number of edges traversed. In general, the
cost of each edge is 1, but there may be special areas where the cost is higher. There are nobst
obstacles at some points on the grid through which one can not proceed.
